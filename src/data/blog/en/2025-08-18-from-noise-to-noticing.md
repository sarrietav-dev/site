After going to the gym, I wanted to take my dog for a walk. Usually, I bring my headphones and listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks. But lately, I’ve been trying to create moments where I stop consuming content and instead reflect on what I’ve already taken in. So, I decided to leave my headphones at home.

That holiday morning was wonderfully calm. I could hear the wind moving through the leaves, birds chirping and fluttering, the gentle sound of foliage detaching from branches and brushing the ground. Small details came alive: ants marching across the sidewalk, worms crawling in the dirt, and doves, kingbirds, and flycatchers bathing together in a shallow pond left by yesterday’s rain.

And I thought to myself—why are so many of us reluctant to experience this? We are so accustomed to living inside our own information bubbles that we often overlook the beauty around us. We convince ourselves that filling every spare moment with content is “productive,” but in reality, we may just be numbing our minds with a constant flow of information, choking our thoughts before they have space to breathe. Or perhaps we are simply afraid—afraid of being alone with our own minds, of confronting the uncomfortable truths that reflection may reveal. Like children afraid of the dark, we avoid opening the closet of our thoughts.

I believe it’s a healthy exercise to let our minds breathe fresh air and wander freely. It doesn’t have to happen only during a walk—I also practice this after reading or listening to something. Yes, sometimes we might encounter our “monsters” as well as treasures. But we should take courage, because the best ideas often emerge from those very moments of silence and reflection.
