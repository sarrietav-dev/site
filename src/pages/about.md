Hi, I'm Sebastián Arrieta, a Colombian software developer passionate about creating systems that make a meaningful difference in people's lives. I enjoy learning new technologies and fostering collaboration within development teams to deliver effective solutions.

Outside of programming, I like spending time reading my Bible and volunteering at my local church, where I find inspiration and purpose beyond work.

Currently, I'm focused on improving my writing skills through a blog where I share ideas about programming and system design. I'm also excited about the adventure of starting my own company.
